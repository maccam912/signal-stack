# Signal Stack

A frantic junk-stacking game created for the [20 Second Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/20-second-game-jam-2024).

## 🎮 About

Your ham radio tower just collapsed and the apocalypse is starting - talk about bad timing! The local ham net starts in 20 seconds and you need to get back on the air. Quickly pile up whatever junk you can find to raise your antenna as high as possible before time runs out!

## 🕒 Gameplay

- **Time Limit**: 20 seconds to build your makeshift antenna tower
- **Physics-Based**: Stack junk realistically using physics simulation
- **Height Matters**: The higher your antenna, the better your signal
- **Quick Rounds**: Perfect for "just one more try" gameplay

## 🎯 Objective

When your ham radio tower collapses at the start of the apocalypse, you have exactly 20 seconds to improvise a new one from nearby junk. Stack items as high as you can - every bit of height helps you reach more survivors in the ham radio network!
